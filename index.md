# Technologies
Listed here and grouped by market sector are the various technologies, tools, and methodologies I am familiar with and confident using. This is not an exhaustive list.

### The Basics

**C/C++**  
I regularly write applications and tools, professionally and personally, in `C` and `C++`, which includes using `gcc`, `Make`, `CMake`, `autoconf`, and other build and compilation toolsets.

**Java**  
My first love in the coding world, `Java` has been my go-to for scaled object oriented solutions or anything that would benefit from inheritance. The typing methodology, JIT performance, and platform compatibility have been of great use to me. I am familiar with the surrounding tool-sphere (`Groovy`, `Gradle`, `Maven`, etc).

**Python**  
I use `Python` professionally to do just about everything relating to networking, and privately for just about everything else.

**Instruction sets**  
Though I don't regularly write `Assembly`, I am familiar with common instruction sets and processes.


### Modern Technologies

**Node.js**  
I absolutely love `Node.js`. Ryan Dahl's creation has taken the web dev world by storm and I am no exception. There is no easier way to spin up a server and make it pretty. Furthermore, I have used the non-blocking architecture to cheaply handle many concurrent requests in several deployed applications, both professionally and privately. Particularly, `Hapi`'s approach to server management is a joy for both API building and web-app building.

**Golang**  
Google's Golang is a wonderfully modern intrepretation of the compiled langauge. I use it professionally to build tools that can run on various architectures and interact with proprietary APIs. Privately, I use it to demonstrate string implementations with pointers for the coding class that I teach.

**No SQL**  
`Mongo` and `Redis` are very useful tools that I have used in both professional and personal settings.


### Web Tech

**Angular.js**  
I've used `Angular 1` and `Angular 2` to quickly build powerful user interfaces for multiple clients.

**Express and Hapi**  
Both of these frameworks provide solid bases for fast and powerful APIs, or to efficiently deliver front ends.

**Django**  
Python's web delivery library serves to broaden the swiss army language's already stunning scope.

**React/JSX**  
By far my favorite front end framework, I have used React in professional settings to create API-driven UIs. JSX templating is absolutely the best way.

**SQL**  
I have built, deployed, and used several different SQL flavors, including but not limited to MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

**Other web tech**  
CSS5, Material UI, HTML5, Socket.io


### Functional / Procedural

**Lisp**  
First-class everything is brilliant and fun. I would love to work with this language professionally.

**Haskell**
