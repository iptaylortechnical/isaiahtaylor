# Technologies
Listed here and grouped by market sector are the various technologies, tools, and methodologies I am familiar with and confident using. This is not an exhaustive list.

### The Basics

**C/C++**
I regularly write applications and tools, professionally and personally, in `C` and `C++`, which includes using `gcc`, `Make`, `CMake`, `autoconf`, and other build and compilation toolsets.

**Java**
My first love in the coding world, `Java` has been my go-to for scaled object oriented solutions or anything that would benefit from inheritance. The typing methodology, JIT performance, and platform compatibility have been of great use to me. I am familiar with the surrounding tool-sphere (`Groovy`, `Gradle`, `Maven`, etc).

**Python**
I use `Python` professionally to do just about everything relating to networking, and privately for just about everything else.

**Instruction sets**
Though I don't regularly write `Assembly`, I am familiar with common instruction sets and processes.


### Modern Languages

**Node.js**
I absolutely love `Node.js`. Ryan Dahl's creation has taken the web dev world by storm and I am no exception. There is no easier way to spin up a server and make it pretty. Furthermore, I have used the non-blocking architecture to cheaply handle many concurrent requests in several deployed applications, both professionally and privately. Particularly, `Hapi`'s approach to server management is a joy for both API building and web-app building.

**Golang**
Google's Golang is a wonderfully modern intrepretation of the compiled langauge.
